\usage{
knn(data, d, K, tutorialMode)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Input Data (must be a data.frame)}

\item{d}{Degree of outlier or distance at which an event is considered an outlier}

\item{K}{Nearest neighbor for which an event must have a degree of outlier to be considered an outlier}

\item{tutorialMode}{if TRUE the tutorial mode is activated (the algorithm will include an explanation detailing the theory behind the outlier detection algorithm and a step by step explanation of how is the data processed to obtain the outliers following the theory mentioned earlier)}
}
\description{
This function implements the knn algorithm for outlier detection
}
\examples{
inputData = t(matrix(c(3,2,3.5,12,4.7,4.1,5.2,
4.9,7.1,6.1,6.2,5.2,14,5.3),2,7,dimnames=list(c("r","d"))))
inputData = data.frame(inputData)
knn(inputData,3,2,FALSE) #Can be changed to TRUE
